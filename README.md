# 🔮 Guess_Me 🤔

This Python script implements a number guessing game where the player tries to guess the computer's secret number, and the computer tries to guess the player's number. It offers two modes: the computer can choose the player's number randomly, or the computer can intelligently guess using a binary search algorithm. The game provides an engaging experience where both the player and the computer compete to guess the other's number in the fewest attempts.
